| Oct 9  | 10:30-11:15pm | I spent a majority of my time drawing out different ideas to speed up the process of searching for the STR. The best idea I can come up with is by finding all instances of the first letter of the STR in the sequence and using those indicies to plug into a function that checks whether it (1) matches the sequence and if so, goes to the letter after to see if it can get longer or (2) does not and can skip the index right as it sees a mismatch. During this process, there will be a counter that looks for max instances. I can't fully tell if this idea is much faster because it would be O(n + some value that could be less than nm). I ran it and passed all checks except it says that it ran out of memory trying to create a large String. I wonder if it's quicker to traverse through each letter and return false immediately once we know one character in the String is wrong or if .equals() already does that. |

I've been thinking of splitting up the string into different parts, but even then the length/size it takes up is still the same. I'm struggling to find a solution to save space.. I know we will likely figure out what this new data structure is in class but my goal was to think of a way to save space on my own. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. |

In class, we got a hint on how to quicken the pace of the search, by assigning a numerical value for a constant check rather than a search through the string and using .equals(). I tried to implement the numerical check in just my find() function but quickly realized that that doesn't change the speed by much, and that I needed to change my approach. |

Now trying to debug because I'm finding too many repeats. |
