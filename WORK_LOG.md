| Oct 9 | 10:30-11:15pm | I spent a majority of my time drawing out different ideas to speed up the process of searching for the STR. The best idea I can come up with is by finding all instances of the first letter of the STR in the sequence and using those indicies to plug into a function that checks whether it (1) matches the sequence and if so, goes to the letter after to see if it can get longer or (2) does not and can skip the index right as it sees a mismatch. During this process, there will be a counter that looks for max instances. I can't fully tell if this idea is much faster because it would be O(n + some value that could be less than nm). I ran it and passed all checks except it says that it ran out of memory trying to create a large String. I wonder if it's quicker to traverse through each letter and return false immediately once we know one character in the String is wrong or if .equals() already does that. |
